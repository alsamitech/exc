EXC: A small library that brings features to C that it should have had in the first place.


EXMem contains basic C String and memory functions, that should be included in the standard library anyway
Functions:
  atokl: Compound String Tokenizer
  starts_with: Checks if a the first argument starts with the second argument's contents.
  read_file: returns the contetns of a file as a char*, also gives back the length of the string, so no need to waste CPU cycles on using strlen, and you're not screwed when you read a binary file.
  get_line: Allocates a string of the exact size of one line, and reads the line character by character.
  ptvec: Gets the length of a null-terminated pointer vector (see https://www.als.fyi/documentation/articles/null_term_arrays.html for more information about null-terminated vectors)
Definitions:
  ARR_FOREACH: makes a for-each loop for an arr_t
  ifrange: an if statement that executes the code within it if var is at least <least> and at most, <most>
  dotimes: Executes what's within the loop x times with y index vaiable
  s_foreach: makes a for-each loop for every character in a string, minus the null termination character at the end of the string.

EXArr:
EXArr contains basic array structures and functions.
Contetns of the arr_t struct:
struct _ArrS{
  void* arr;
  long unsigned int len;
}

Functions:
  arr_getbylast: gets the last element in an arr_t, minus the offset (for a CString, use 1 as the offset to get the last non-null char)

Compile:
  You don't even need make to compile exc! It simply takes two commands to compile manually, or you can just use "sh build" to build the library.
